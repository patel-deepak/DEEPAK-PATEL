Definitions:-
1. Nodejs:-
Node js is a server side platform for executing
javascript
code.
2. ​ Variables:-
There are three types of Variables 1. Var 2.Let 3.Const.
1. Var ​ ​ declarations are globally scoped or function scoped and it can be
updated and re-declared within its scope.
2. Let declarations are locally scope and it can be update but not
re-declared.
3. Const variables never update and re-declared.
3.DataType​ :-
There are two types of dataTypes
1.Primitive dataTypes is pre-defined
1.Number
2.Boolean
3.Undefined
4.Null
5.Floate
2. Non-Primitive data types are actually not defined. It is defined by the
coder.
1.String
2.Array
3.Object
4.Classes
4.Function​ :
A function is a block of code to perform a particular task. It will
executed when it will call5.Objectes:​ -
Object is a container which store names , values called
properties or methods​ .
6.Array:-
Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single
variable.
7.
Use Strict :-
Strict mode, you can not, for example, use undeclared
variables.
And ​ the ​ this​ keyword in functions behaves differently
in strict mode.
8.ECMAScript:-
It is latest version of JavaScript and has many new features.
● Arrow Function >>>​ Arrow functions allow us to write shorter
function syntax
● ES6 >>>​ The ​ let​ keyword​ * ​ The ​ const​ keyword​ * ​ JavaScript Arrow Functions
● JavaScript Class​ * ​ JavaScript Promise​ * ​ JavaScript Symbol​ * ​ Default
Parameter Values
● Function Rest Parameter​ * ​ Array.find()​ * ​ Array.findIndex()​ * ​ New
Number Properties​ * ​ New Number Methods
* ​ New Global Methods
● EcmaScript 2016 >>> there are two new features 1.​ Exponentiation
(**) ​ 2.Array.prototype.includes
● EcmaScript 2017 >>> There are some ​ ​ new features in
EcmaScript 2017 1.string Padding 2. Object entries and
Values 3. Async Function
9.​ JSON:-
JSON is a format for storing and transporting data.JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a
web page.
JSON’s data is the Key-Values form.
10​ . CallBack Function:-
A callback function is taking a parameter and
another function will be inside the callback function. A callback
function can run after another function has finished.
11.Asychronous:-
Asynchronous is running in parallel with another
function that means all functions will run the same time and who
has taken less time that is executed first and who takes more time
that is executed in the last.
12. Promises:-
There are three part of the promises first is pending
that means promise has been working and second is
resolve(Fulfilled) in their .then is working for resolve and last third
is reject that means if any error in our code with the help of .catch
we find out the error.
Conclusion is that we have found the result or error easily with the
help of promises.
13.Async/Await:-Async makes a function and in that function return
a promise and waits until all functions has executed ,then after
executing that async/await function.
Await can only be use inside the async function and before a
function makes the function wait for a promise.
14. NPM:-
NPM is a Node Package Manager , who has managed
node packages like ​ package installation, version management, and
dependency management.
15. Package.json:-
All the NPM packages are stored in one file called
package. Json.
When writing npm init on the terminal it will create
automatically.
16. Package-lock.json:-
Package-lock.json file automatically generated and
in the file stored node-modules tree that means in the file all
packages full details had been stored.
17.Nodemon:-Nodemon​ is a utility that if you change a file and save it then it
will automatically work(run) on the terminal so we don’t have to run again.
18. Require:-
The require function works like if we want data from
another directory or file and MiddleWere (body-parser,cookies,JWT)
then we have to use the Require function.
19.Express:-
Express is a minimal and flexible
NodeJS web
application Framework.
It is for web development and mobile applications that send
requests on the server.
20.CRUD Method:-
In express for Get Data ,Insert Data , Update Data ,
Delete Data ​ f ​ or getting data show on the browser
and if we have insert data , update data and delete
data we have to use Postman on the postman we
can send post requests, put requests ,delete
requests e.t.c .21. MYSQL Database:-
Mysql is a relational database​ and it is for storing
data in a database.
22. Migrations/Seeds :-
Migration is easy to work with mysql db ,
it is used for creating or removing many tables only one time.
23. Knex:-
Knex is a query builder SQL database of node js. If you
use knex then you can write code easily
